  I was unable to update the .jsonfile when a new account would be registered.  This is because I was unable
  to update the json file without using the AccountManager class, the Sign Up button only utilizes
  the Ksec chain functions which were unable to reach the json file OR the UserData struct.  The workaround created
  was to quickly populate the singleton currentAccount, quickly save the account to the json file and then logout immediatley
